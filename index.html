                "A new 'look' for any organization cannot be a papier-mache cover, tacked on with Scotch tape under the
                heading of 'beautification.' It has to be based on a probing examination of the company and the people
                who work for it. As a result, the eventual external visual design becomes the graphic extension of the
                internal realities of a company." -Saul Bass</p>

                    <p>Saul Bass, was an influential graphic designer/ artist best known for his movie poster designs.
                        Bass created some of the most iconic designs for posters in design history, under the ‘Swiss
                        style’. However, a lot of his work could be seen under the ‘modernist’ movement, due to the
                        amount of negative space and uses of simple, geometric shapes.

                    <p>György Kepes, born in 1906, hungary, moved to America in 1937 after leaving Berlin due to the
                        war. By 1944 he would attend Brooklyn College, teaching night class where Saul Bass would be
                        found.</p>
                    <p>Bass's work would then go on ti be influenced by Kepes which drew on a variety of modern
                        influences, including Matisse's cut-outs, De Stijl, Russian Constructivism, and eventually, the

                        posters for movies, some of which became so renowned to make such an impact in today’s world of

                            Jones and The Man With The Golden Arm and at some point, Otto and I just looked at each

                <p>When 'The Man With The Golden Arm' opened in New York in 1952, he featured an animated paper cut-out
                    arm
                    in the film title which had a sensational effect on the audience. The symbol was used on the
                    marquee. It
                    was an accurate and telling synthesis of the film in the ad campaign, those same qualities came with
                    it

            <h2>"Kinetic typography"</h2>
            <p>What is Kinetic typography?</p>
            <p>Also known as text animation. kinetic typography is a design technique that uses emotion and animated
                elements to create movement and visual interest with text. Once created he based his creations on the
                philosophy of enlightening the audience about the subject of the film and invoking their emotions.</p>
            <p> Now to discuss who invented this technique. That's correct Saul Bass. Bass invented a new type of
                kinetic typography for his work on Alfred Hitchcock's films North by Northwest (1959), Vertigo (1958),
                and Psycho (1960).
                This style was created with the intention to convay emotions and visual interest to the audience. Such
                as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054215/">Phsyco (1960)</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052357/">Vertigo (1958)</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053125/">North by Northwest (1959)</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The movie seuqences that Saul Bass created would go on to make such an impact in the design and movie
                industry with future film sequences being created in a similar design, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114369/">Se7en (1995)</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0804503/">Mad Men (2007-2015)</a></li>
