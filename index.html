                    "A new 'look' for any organization cannot be a papier-mache cover, tacked on with Scotch tape under
                    the
                    heading of 'beautification.' It has to be based on a probing examination of the company and the
                    people
                    who work for it. As a result, the eventual external visual design becomes the graphic extension of
                    the

                    <p>Saul Bass, was an influential graphic designer/ artist best known for his movie poster designs.
                        Bass created some of the most iconic designs for posters in design history, under the ‘Swiss
                        style’. However, a lot of his work could be seen under the ‘modernist’ movement, due to the
                        amount of negative space and uses of simple, geometric shapes.

                        found.</p>
                    <p>Bass's work would then go on ti be influenced by Kepes which drew on a variety of modern

                    <p><br><br><br>By 1952 Saul Bass would begin to set up his very own graphic design practice in Los
                        Angeles,
                        California. It was called ‘Saul Bass & Associates’. His practice would begin work by designing
                        posters for movies, some of which became so renowned to make such an impact in today’s world of
                        design.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Bass would go on to create these poster designs in a very minimalistic style. Most
                of the features within his designs would be what hihglights the movie it is representing. For
                example, the highlight for the movie 'Man with the golden arm", was the arm. Which was not only
                used for the poster but would also be featured in his movie sequences down the line.</p>

                        However, Bass would go on to design some of the most iconic corporate logos such as:</p>

                    Preminger's Carmen Jones and The Man With The Golden Arm and at some point, Otto and I just looked
                    at each other and said, “Why not make it move?."</p>

                <p>When 'The Man With The Golden Arm' opened in New York in 1952, he featured an animated paper cut-out
                    arm in the film title which had a sensational effect on the audience. The symbol was used on the
                    marquee. It was an accurate and telling synthesis of the film in the ad campaign, those same
                    qualities came with it into the theater and with the addition of motion and sound.</p>

                <p>Saul Bass would go on to design the sequence as a series of abstract like patterns using white
                    rectangles, which would appearing on the black screen. His colour palette choice was chosen to
                    convay the movies "intensity and subject matter". When bass was creating the movie sequence he came
                    up for a meaning for every feature and movment in that sequences that hints or resonates with what
                    happens in the movie. Aside from the colours, the lines were made to reference a stabbing motion
                    which was to represent the drug addiction and Bass's desire to be a drummer.
                    Another feature that was mentioned was the arm. Inspired by the arm of Bass's art director, Art
                    Goodman. It was designed to represent a distorted, disconnected arm that's petrified and not
                    attached to a body.

                        elements to create movement and visual interest with text. Once created he based his creations
                        on the
                        philosophy of enlightening the audience about the subject of the film and invoking their
                        emotions.

                        kinetic typography for his work on Alfred Hitchcock's films North by Northwest (1959), Vertigo

                        and Psycho (1960).
                        This style was created with the intention to convay emotions and visual interest to the

            <p>A lot of movie title sequences now a days all have their own takes and styles but most of which can all
                usually be linked back to Saul bass in some form. The examples that had just been shown usally all
                featured quick cuts, plane colours, geometric shapes, etc. All of which are traits that Saul bas used in
                his movie seuqnces that created his success.</p>

                    <p>György Kepes, Bass's mentor would be the person to introduce him to a couple of art movements.
                        All of which Bass somehow implemented into his work.
                        A lot of his movie sequences seemed to feature the use of Matisse's cut-outs, which were also
                        featured in his movie poster designs such as the man with the golden arm.

                        As previously stated, a lot of Saul Bass's work is used with very minimal and flat colours. Most
                        of which featured the colour or shades of red such as yellow, orange, brown, etc. Some or most
                        of his movie sequences would usually always begin with a dark or black background and light or
                        white minimal
                        text that would fade or change into movie features or more conten. The reason this could be was
                        his attempt to achieve a sort of visual impact on the audience.

                <div class="column">

                    <p>Upon completing my research of who Saul Bass is, his life, his work, his impact and his
                        influences I have come to the result that i do believe Bass could be hihgly considered the
                        "Father" if movie sequence designs hence becoming the "Pioneer". Even with the opinions of
                        others within the community of art or not he can still be considered one of or the most
                        inspirable persons around when it comes to not only movie sequences but also poster designs.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                    <p>Following the previous entry, The work Saul Bass producded, taking full advantage
                        of his creative prowess and any other exisitng materials he maynhave at hand. With his movie
                        title sequences, I believe he became the unoffical pioneer of others soly from what has been
                        produced after his work and even to this present day. In other words, the movie sequences we get
                        now all seem to have vast similarites, ties or straight one to one overlays of Basses work and
                        without his sequences we may not have successful or satisfying movie seuqences we have now.</p>
                </div>

            </div>

            <p> Overall, From the evidence that was gathered, Saul Bass could be highly considered as "The Pioneer of
                Movie Sequences" due to the impact his title sequences would have made for the movie and on the
                audience.
                As previously stated, Saul Bass created his movie sequences in a way to convay emotion, impact and
                meaning behind it all, wether it is related to the movie or to the audience, what others aswell as
                myself believe to be what made his work so successful. The reason I believe this is due to how Bass seen
                the movie sequences as the intro or beginning of the movie which was also key to begin setting the scene
                or mood of that movie. For example, The sequence into the movie "Anatomy of a Murder" always gave off a
                mystery type of feel to the sequence but would always express or show the "Dead body" of a character
                which
                is what the movie was based around, making it an easy transistion for the movie to begin.
