                <p>Saul Bass, was an influential graphic designer/ artist best known for his movie poster designs. Bass created some of the most iconic designs for posters in design history, under the ‘Swiss style’. However, a lot of his work could be seen under the ‘modernist’ movement, due to the amount of negative space and uses of simple, geometric shapes.
