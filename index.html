                    "A new 'look' for any organization cannot be a papier-mache cover, tacked on with Scotch tape under
                    the
                    heading of 'beautification.' It has to be based on a probing examination of the company and the
                    people
                    who work for it. As a result, the eventual external visual design becomes the graphic extension of
                    the
                    internal realities of a company." -Saul Bass</p>

                    <p>Saul Bass, was an influential graphic designer/ artist best known for his movie poster designs.
                        Bass created some of the most iconic designs for posters in design history, under the ‘Swiss
                        style’. However, a lot of his work could be seen under the ‘modernist’ movement, due to the
                        amount of negative space and uses of simple, geometric shapes.

                <p>When 'The Man With The Golden Arm' opened in New York in 1952, he featured an animated paper cut-out

                    in the film title which had a sensational effect on the audience. The symbol was used on the

                        philosophy of enlightening the audience about the subject of the film and invoking their

                        and Psycho (1960).
                        This style was created with the intention to convay emotions and visual interest to the

                    <br><br>
                    <p>György Kepes, Bass's mentor would be the person to introduce him to a couple of art movements.
                        All of which Bass somehow implemented into his work.
                        A lot of his movie sequences seemed to feature the use of Matisse's cut-outs, which were also
                        featured in his movie poster designs such as the man with the golden arm.

                        As previously stated, a lot of Saul Bass's work is used with very minial and flat colours. Most
                        of which featured the colour or shades of red such as yellow, orange, brown, etc. Some or most
                        of his movie
                        sequences featured just plain black and white. The reason this could be was his attempt to
                        achieve a sort of visual impact on the audience
